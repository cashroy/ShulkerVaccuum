ShulkerVaccuum Plugin 

Overview:

The ShulkerVaccuum plugin enhances the functionality of Shulker Boxes in Minecraft by introducing two new types of Shulker Boxes with special behaviors: the Vacuum Shulker Box and the Trash Shulker Box. These custom Shulker Boxes can be crafted through unique recipes and have distinct effects when used in-game.

1. Custom Shulker Box Recipes:

The plugin adds two custom Shulker Boxes to the game, each with its own unique functionality:
	•	Vacuum Shulker Box (Shulker Box of Vacuum)
	•	Trash Shulker Box (Shulker Box of Trash)

These Shulker Boxes can be crafted through new recipes that use any colored Shulker Box as an ingredient.

2. Vacuum Shulker Box:
	•	Crafting Recipe:
	•	The Vacuum Shulker Box can be crafted using any colored Shulker Box and a Hopper.
	•	The Vacuum Shulker Box has custom lore: "Vacuum I", and a persistent data tag that marks it as a “vacuum” Shulker Box.
	•	Behavior:
	•	When a player holds a Vacuum Shulker Box in their off-hand, it automatically collects items (such as block drops) that fall on the ground and stores them inside the Shulker Box. This mimics a vacuum-like functionality.

3. Trash Shulker Box:
	•	Crafting Recipe:
	•	The Trash Shulker Box can be crafted using any colored Shulker Box and a Lava Bucket.
	•	The Trash Shulker Box has custom lore: "Trash I", and a persistent data tag that marks it as a “trash” Shulker Box.
	•	Behavior:
	•	When a player holds a Trash Shulker Box in their off-hand, it automatically discards any items (block drops) that fall on the ground without storing them. This simulates an auto-delete functionality for unwanted items.
